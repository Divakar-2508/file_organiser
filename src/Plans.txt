Great, you've made significant progress on your project! You've successfully retrieved a list of files from the current directory and filtered out only the files. At this stage, you have a foundation to build upon. Here are some steps you can consider for further enhancing your CLI tool:

1. **Implement Organizing Logic:**
   
   Since your project's main goal is to organize files, now it's time to implement the logic for organizing files based on their extensions into separate folders. You can use the code you developed earlier for this purpose. You'll need to create folders with extension names and move the corresponding files into those folders.

2. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   
   Instead of always organizing files in the current directory, you might want to make your tool more flexible by allowing users to provide a directory path as a command-line argument. You can use the `clap` or `structopt` crate to easily parse command-line arguments and options.

3. **Error Handling:**
   
   While your current code does some basic error handling with `expect`, you might want to improve this by providing more informative error messages and handling different types of errors gracefully. Consider using the `Result` type and `match` statements for better error handling.

4. **User Interaction:**
   
   You could enhance the user experience by adding informative messages, progress indicators, and prompts for user confirmation before performing actions like organizing files.

5. **Logging:**
   
   Integrate a logging framework like `log` to track the progress and actions of your tool. This can help you troubleshoot issues and keep track of what your tool is doing.

6. **Testing:**
   
   As your tool becomes more complex, testing becomes crucial. Implement unit tests and integration tests using Rust's built-in testing framework or external crates like `assert_cli`.

7. **Documentation:**
   
   Document your code with clear comments, explanations, and examples. You can also generate documentation using Rust's built-in `rustdoc` tool.

8. **User-Friendly Messages:**

   Provide clear and user-friendly messages when interacting with the tool. Explain what's happening and what the user should expect.

9. **Extensibility:**

   Design your code in a modular and extensible way so that you can easily add new features or improvements in the future.

Remember that building software is an iterative process. Start with the core functionality and gradually refine and expand it based on your needs and user feedback. Good luck with your project!
